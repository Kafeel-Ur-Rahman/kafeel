1. Set Up WordPress and ACF Plugin
Install WordPress if you haven’t already.
Install and activate the Advanced Custom Fields plugin.
2. Create a New Theme or Child Theme
If you’re not using an existing theme, create a new theme folder in /wp-content/themes/.
Create essential files like style.css, index.php, and functions.php.
Or, if you’re modifying an existing theme, consider using a child theme to keep it update-safe.
3. Convert HTML Structure into WordPress Template Files
Break your HTML into WordPress template files. Common files include:
header.php for the head and header section.
footer.php for the footer section.
page.php for static pages.
single.php for individual posts or content items.
Insert WordPress functions like <?php bloginfo('name'); ?> or <?php wp_head(); ?> as needed for WordPress compatibility.
4. Set Up ACF Fields for Dynamic Content
Go to Custom Fields > Add New in the WordPress dashboard.
Create Field Groups for each page or template area that needs dynamic content.
For example, for a "Team" section, you could create fields like “Team Member Name,” “Position,” and “Image.”
Assign these field groups to the relevant pages or templates using location rules.
