1. Set Up the WordPress Environment
Install WordPress on your local development server or hosting.
Create a new theme folder in wp-content/themes and name it appropriately (e.g., myonepage).
2. Add HTML and CSS Files
Copy your HTML and CSS files into the new theme folder. Split the HTML structure into separate WordPress template files to make it manageable.
header.php: Contains the opening HTML tags, meta tags, and stylesheets.
footer.php: Contains the closing tags.
front-page.php: Main file for your one-page layout.
Link any stylesheets or JavaScript in the header.php or footer.php.
3. Create a WordPress Loop in front-page.php
Replace any static content with WordPress loop functions where needed.
Use get_header() and get_footer() to include your header and footer files.
4. Set Up Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
Install the ACF plugin in WordPress.
Go to Custom Fields > Add New in the WordPress dashboard.
Create field groups that match the sections on your one-page site (e.g., Hero, About, Services, Contact).
5. Replace Static Content with ACF Fields
In each section of your HTML, replace static content with dynamic content from ACF. For example:
php
Copy code
<h1><?php the_field('hero_title'); ?></h1>
<p><?php the_field('hero_description'); ?></p>
For images or other media, use:
php
Copy code
<img src="<?php the_field('image_field'); ?>" alt="">
6. Make the Page Dynamic
Go to Settings > Reading and set your home page to the new custom front page.
Ensure all ACF fields are set up and that your template pulls in data from the WordPress dashboard, making it easy to update the content without altering code.
7. Test and Deploy
Review the page, making sure all ACF fields display correctly.
Test responsiveness and functionality.
Once satisfied, upload the theme to your live server if needed.
